Servos are controllled using PWM signals 

Servo colour code
red=+ve
brown=-ve
orange=pwm

servis like to sww a 50 hz Control signal 

The position of the Servo depends on the Pulse Width of the on Part of the cycle
Most Servos are fully left with around a 1msec pulsewidth 

most servos are in the middle postion with a 1.5 msec pulse width are in Fully right position

Math 
Period= 1/frequency 

cor 50 hz the period of the signal is 
Period =1/frequency=1/50 =0.2 =20 milli seconds



To be in the full left Position, we would want a pulse width of 1 ms . ms 
want a would be a Dutycycle of 0.5x20ms wolud be equal to 1ms
.So for fulll left would want a a Dutycycle of 5% on a 50hz signal



for 50hz full left is 5%of Dutycycle center position is 7.5% and full right is 10% duty cycle
